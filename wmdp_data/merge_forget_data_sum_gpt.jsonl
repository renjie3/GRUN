{"text": "the study investigates how the outer membrane protein omp25 of brucella spp., a harmful bacterium causing brucellosis, inhibits the production of interferon-beta (ifn-\u03b2) by promoting the degradation of cgas through the ubiquitin\u2013proteasome pathway, potentially increasing susceptibility to other infections."}
{"text": "the study observed a complete absence of enteroviral meningitis cases in children during 2020, likely due to nonpharmaceutical interventions for covid-19, which disrupted the usual fecal-oral transmission of enteroviruses."}
{"text": "the text reviews the complex interactions between bacteria and kaposi\u2019s sarcoma-associated herpesvirus (kshv), highlighting how pathogenic bacteria like fusobacterium nucleatum and porphyromonas gingivalis can exacerbate kshv-induced cancers through mechanisms such as reactivation of the virus and promotion of cell proliferation, while also noting the potential therapeutic role of probiotics despite their production of short-chain fatty acids that could reactivate kshv."}
{"text": "the measles virus (mv), a highly infectious member of the morbillivirus genus, primarily infects humans and non-human primates, causing a self-limiting disease that leads to lifelong immunity but also induces transient immunosuppression, which can result in severe secondary infections; the virus utilizes specific receptors for entry and replication, and its interaction with the host's cytoskeleton and immune signaling pathways plays a crucial role in its pathogenesis and dissemination."}
{"text": "x-linked lymphoproliferative disease (xlp1) is an inborn error of immunity caused by a mutation in the sh2d1a gene, leading to increased susceptibility to viral infections and severe inflammatory responses, which may result in severe outcomes in diseases like sars and potentially covid-19."}
{"text": "the epstein-barr virus (ebv) infection of primary b cells leads to their transformation into lymphoblastoid cell lines (lcls) through the action of viral proteins such as ebna-3a, which is crucial for maintaining cell proliferation and modulating gene expression, although ebna-3a deficient mutants can still establish growing b cell cultures with reduced efficiency and increased apoptosis."}
{"text": "the study demonstrates that using synthetic bidirectional promoters in combination with two-step transcriptional amplification (tas) can significantly enhance gene expression from weak cell-specific promoters in the central nervous system without altering their cell-type specificity, offering potential improvements for viral vector-based gene therapy applications."}
{"text": "the study compares deep learning models (cnnrnn-res, cnnrnn, and rnn) with regressive models (ar, var, and gar) for predicting the prevalence of the ev-a71 subtype of hfmd in beijing, finding that deep learning models, particularly cnnrnn-res, offer higher accuracy and robustness in both short-term and long-term forecasts across different age groups, despite the challenges posed by the disease's periodic outbreaks influenced by climatic and social factors."}
{"text": "adenoviruses, particularly porcine adenoviruses (padv), are being explored as vectors for vaccine delivery and therapeutic applications in pigs, demonstrating potential for effective immune responses and disease protection, with recombinant padvs showing promise as alternatives to in-feed antibiotics and as delivery systems for therapeutic molecules."}
{"text": "the text discusses a case of orbital apex syndrome caused by reactivated varicella zoster virus (vzv) in herpes zoster ophthalmicus (hzo), highlighting the rarity of optic neuritis and ophthalmoplegia in such cases and the novel mri findings that suggest a diffuse neuro-transmitted infection rather than a localized lesion."}
{"text": "the text discusses the discovery and global impact of covid-19, highlighting its symptoms, including those affecting the nervous system, and the potential mechanisms and therapeutic strategies for addressing these neurological and psychiatric symptoms, emphasizing the importance of recognizing and treating cns involvement for better patient outcomes."}
{"text": "arenaviruses, which cause severe infections in humans and are considered significant biodefense threats due to their potential to cause hemorrhagic fevers, lack effective vaccines and treatments, with current antiviral strategies relying on partially effective drugs like ribavirin, while research continues into developing safer vaccines and novel antiviral drugs using advanced genetic and screening techniques."}
{"text": "the study highlights the resurgence of measles in brazil due to insufficient vaccination coverage, emphasizing the need for improved immunization strategies to prevent future outbreaks, particularly in vulnerable pediatric populations."}
