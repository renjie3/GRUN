{"text": "du fu was a prominent chinese poet of the tang dynasty, known alongside li bai as one of the greatest chinese poets, whose life and ambitions were disrupted by the an lushan rebellion."}
{"text": "initially little-known, the poet became highly influential in chinese and japanese literary culture, with nearly fifteen hundred preserved poems, earning him titles such as \"poet-historian\" and \"poet-sage\" in china and comparisons to western literary figures like virgil and shakespeare."}
{"text": "traditional chinese literary criticism focuses on the author's life to interpret works, especially for poets like du fu, due to the close ties between art and morality, the concise nature of chinese poetry, and the diverse range of du fu's work."}
{"text": "most of what is known about du fu's life is derived from his poems, with his grandfather being a notable politician and poet, and du fu himself being born in 712 near luoyang, later associating himself with chang'an."}
{"text": "du fu was partially raised by his aunt after his mother's death, had an elder brother who died young, and frequently referenced his three half-brothers and one half-sister in his poems, but never mentioned his stepmother."}
{"text": "the text describes the early life of a scholar's son who was educated in confucian classics and claimed to have written notable poems in his early teens, although these works have not survived."}
{"text": "in the early 730s, he traveled in the jiangsu/zhejiang area, wrote his earliest surviving poem around 735, failed the civil service exam likely due to his dense prose style or lack of connections, and then continued traveling in shandong and hebei."}
{"text": "after his father's death around 740, du fu gave up his privilege to enter the civil service in favor of his half-brother and spent four years in the luoyang area managing domestic affairs."}
{"text": "du fu's friendship with li bai, which began in 744, significantly influenced his artistic development, although the relationship was somewhat one-sided with du fu being the younger and less established poet."}
{"text": "in an attempt to revive his official career, du fu moved to the capital in 746, faced setbacks in civil service exams, petitioned the emperor directly, and dealt with personal challenges including family relocations due to famine and his own health issues."}
{"text": "in 755, he was appointed to a minor official position at the crown prince's palace, but the role was eliminated before he could start due to unforeseen events."}
{"text": "the an lushan rebellion, which lasted nearly eight years starting in december 755, caused significant societal disruption in china, drastically reducing the population and influencing du fu's poetry, which focused on the suffering and experiences of those around him."}
{"text": "in 756, du fu fled with his family to safety during a rebellion, attempted to join the new emperor's court, was captured by rebels, and around this time, he is believed to have contracted malaria."}
{"text": "du fu, after escaping chang'an and being appointed to a largely ceremonial court position in 757, faced arrest for defending a friend, was later pardoned, and despite his unappreciated advice, was demoted to commissioner of education in huazhou in 758, a role he found unsatisfactory."}
{"text": "he moved in the summer of 759, likely due to frustration rather than famine, and spent about six weeks in qinzhou, where he wrote over sixty poems."}

{"text": "hung summarizes his life by describing himself as a devoted family member, loyal friend, dutiful official, and patriotic subject."}
{"text": "the poem \"to my retired friend wei\" by du fu reflects the common tang dynasty theme of long separations between friends, often caused by frequent official transfers to different provinces."}
{"text": "du fu, known as the \"poet historian,\" wrote poems that directly and indirectly commented on military tactics, government successes and failures, and the impact of his era on himself and ordinary chinese people, providing insights rarely found in official histories."}

{"text": "the text discusses the chinese poet du fu, known as the \"poet sage,\" who frequently addressed the sufferings of soldiers and civilians in his works, such as \"the song of the wagons.\""}
{"text": "hawkes suggests that du fu's frequent references to his own difficulties, while seemingly self-centered, actually reflect a broader compassion that includes himself objectively, enhancing the grandeur of the wider picture by contrasting it with his own triviality."}
{"text": "du fu expanded the scope of poetry by writing about a wide range of topics, including domestic life, calligraphy, paintings, animals, and other poems, reflecting his compassion for himself and others."}
{"text": "du fu's work is distinguished by its extensive range, mastering all forms of chinese poetry and employing a variety of styles and themes, with notable contributions to poetics and painting, including a controversial critique of han gan's horse paintings."}
{"text": "the evolution of his work is marked by a shift from a derivative style to a more distinct and powerful vision, reflecting his adaptation to different environments and periods."}
{"text": "about two-thirds of du fu's 1500 surviving works are in the l\u01dcshi form, showcasing his mastery in using its parallelisms to enhance expressive content, with hawkes noting his natural use of this stylized form."}
{"text": "du fu's writings are highly regarded by literary critics for their dense and nuanced language, which is difficult to fully capture in translation, according to the encyclop\u00e6dia britannica."}
{"text": "du fu was not widely appreciated during his lifetime or immediately after his death, partly due to his stylistic innovations, and he is scarcely mentioned in contemporary references and anthologies."}
{"text": "du fu's influence as a chinese poet grew over time, with early praise from bai juyi and han yu, and by the 10th century, his legacy was honored with a replica of his thatched cottage in sichuan."}
{"text": "during the 11th century northern song era, du fu's reputation peaked as he was recognized as a confucian exemplar, admired for his loyalty, technical mastery, and concern for the poor, which later aligned with themes of nationalism and socialism in the people's republic of china."}

{"text": "in the 20th century, kenneth rexroth regarded a certain poet as the greatest non-epic, non-dramatic poet in any language, stating that the poet improved him both morally and perceptually."}
{"text": "du fu's poetry significantly influenced japanese literature, particularly during the muromachi and edo periods, and he is often referred to as the \"saint of poetry\" in modern japanese."}
{"text": "until the 13th century, japanese preference for bai juyi over du fu shifted as figures like kokan shiren and his students began to appreciate and propagate du fu's poetry, leading to its influence in japanese literature and culture during the muromachi period."}
{"text": "during the kan'ei era of the edo period, sh\u00e0o chu\u00e1n's commentary on du fu's poetry became highly popular in japan, influencing confucian scholars and poets like matsuo bash\u014d, who regarded du fu as the greatest poet in history."}
{"text": "translating du fu's poetry into english involves various styles and challenges, such as maintaining formal constraints and complex allusions, with approaches ranging from free translations by kenneth rexroth to more literal interpretations."}
{"text": "the text discusses different translators' approaches to conveying the poetic forms of du fu, with vikram seth and keith holyoak using english and chinese rhyme schemes respectively, while burton watson emphasizes parallelism and combines literal translation with annotation."}

{"text": "the ise-class battleships were a pair of dreadnought battleships built for the imperial japanese navy during world war i, later modernized and used to carry supplies after the great kant\u014d earthquake and played a minor role in the second sino-japanese war."}
{"text": "despite expensive reconstructions, the vessels were considered obsolete by the pacific war, saw limited action, and were eventually sunk in 1945 before being scrapped post-war."}
{"text": "the design of the fus\u014d-class battleships was influenced by the international naval arms race and japan's strategic goal to have a fleet capable of defeating the united states navy in japanese waters, building on their success in the russo-japanese war."}
{"text": "in response to potential conflicts with britain and the united states, the japanese empire initiated the eight-eight fleet program to build a fleet of sixteen capital ships, aiming to maintain a naval force with at least 70% of the us navy's capital ships."}
{"text": "the launch of hms dreadnought in 1906 and hms invincible in 1907 by the royal navy complicated japan's naval plans and led to the restart of the eight-eight fleet program as japan's new battleships and cruisers were outclassed."}
{"text": "the eight-eight fleet program initially faced economic constraints, leading to the approval of only four battlecruisers and one fus\u014d-class battleship, with additional funding later allowing for the construction of three more fus\u014d-class ships."}
{"text": "the ijn reassessed the fus\u014d-class battleship design due to issues with gun turret placement, shell handling, armor thickness, and speed, leading to a new design with improved features but reduced crew accommodations, ultimately resulting in a separate class designation."}
{"text": "the ships measured 208.18 meters in length, had a beam of 28.65 meters, a draught of 8.93 meters, displaced 36,500 long tons at deep load, and accommodated a crew of 1,360, with a metacentric height of 1.737 meters."}
{"text": "during the 1930s modernization, the ships' superstructures were enlarged, torpedo bulges were added, sterns were lengthened, and their displacement increased, resulting in a larger crew size."}
{"text": "the ise-class ships were equipped with steam turbines and boilers that allowed them to exceed their designed speed, using a mixture of coal and oil for fuel, and had a significant range and power generation capacity."}
{"text": "during their 1930s modernization, the ships' boilers and turbines were upgraded to kampon oil-fired boilers and geared turbines, increasing their speed and fuel capacity for extended range."}
{"text": "the ise class battleships were equipped with twelve 45-caliber 35.6 cm type 41 guns mounted in twin-gun turrets, which underwent modifications to increase their elevation and improve their firing cycle from hydraulic to pneumatic systems."}
{"text": "by world war ii, guns used type 91 armor-piercing shells and high-explosive shells with significant range and velocity, and a special incendiary shrapnel shell was developed for anti-aircraft use."}
{"text": "the ships were equipped with a secondary armament of twenty 14-centimetre guns, anti-aircraft defense with four 8-centimetre aa guns, and six submerged torpedo tubes carrying torpedoes with 200-kilogram warheads."}
{"text": "between 1931 and 1933, the aa guns were replaced with eight 40-caliber 12.7 cm type 89 dual-purpose guns and two twin-gun mounts for vickers two-pounder light aa guns, while the pair of 14 cm guns on the upper deck were removed."}
{"text": "during the mid-1930s reconstruction, the torpedo tubes were removed and replaced with twenty hotchkiss 25 mm type 96 light aa guns, which were largely ineffective due to design flaws such as insufficient speed, poor gun sights, excessive vibration, small magazines, and excessive muzzle blast."}
{"text": "the ise-class ships featured a waterline protective belt with a maximum thickness of 299 mm, various layers of high-tensile steel for the armoured decks, and additional armour protection for turrets, casemates, barbettes, and the conning tower."}

{"text": "the ships were equipped with yokosuka d4y dive bombers and aichi e16a reconnaissance aircraft, but due to development issues and a lack of trained pilots, they never used their aircraft in combat."}
{"text": "after the loss of the battleship hiei, the ijn enhanced the steering compartment's protection with a concrete wall and repurposed armor, increased fuel capacity for greater endurance, and added type 22 surface-search radars."}
{"text": "the removal of secondary armament and rear turrets was offset by adding a flight deck, hangar, aa guns, and more fuel, resulting in increased metacentric height, reduced displacement and draught, and changes in overall dimensions."}
{"text": "the sister ships hy\u016bga and ise, part of the 1st battleship division, experienced various incidents and upgrades from 1919 to 1940, including an explosion on hy\u016bga that killed 11 men, and were involved in military exercises and support missions before being refitted for war."}

{"text": "the ijn planned to replace lost carriers with hybrid carriers converted from battleships, selecting ise and hy\u016bga for conversion, which took place at kure and sasebo naval arsenals between 1943."}
{"text": "after completing sea trials, the japanese battleship ise was involved in troop and munitions transport, joined the 2nd battleship division with hy\u016bga, and was later transferred to the fourth carrier division of the 3rd fleet, where its air group conducted catapult launches."}
{"text": "shortages of operational aircraft hindered japanese pilot training and defense plans during the battle of the philippines, leading to ineffective attacks on american carriers and a strategic retreat by vice admiral jisabur\u014d ozawa's forces."}

{"text": "ironclads, steam-propelled warships protected by iron or steel armor, were developed in the 19th century to address the vulnerability of wooden ships to explosive shells, with the first being launched by the french navy in 1859, and they proved highly successful during the american civil war."}
{"text": "ironclads evolved from wooden-hulled, sail-assisted vessels to steel-built, turreted battleships and cruisers in the late 19th century due to advancements in naval guns, steam engines, and metallurgy."}
{"text": "the rapid changes in naval technology during the ironclad period led to frequent obsolescence of ships and evolving tactics, with a shift towards standardized battleships and armored cruisers by the late 1890s."}
{"text": "the ironclad, a type of warship with a metal-skinned hull, steam propulsion, and explosive shell-firing guns, became feasible and necessary due to 19th-century shipbuilding advancements."}
{"text": "in the 18th and early 19th centuries, fleets relied on ships of the line and frigates, with a major change occurring in the 1840s when steam propulsion became suitable for major warships due to the adoption of the screw propeller."}
{"text": "in the mid-1840s, steam-powered screw frigates were developed, and by 1850, the french navy introduced the first purpose-built steam battleship, the napol\u00e9on, to challenge british naval dominance, offering a significant advantage with its ability to maintain a speed of 12 knots regardless of wind conditions."}
{"text": "the introduction of the steam ship led to a building competition between france and britain, with france constructing ten new wooden steam battleships and converting 28 older ships, while the united kingdom built 18 and converted 41."}
{"text": "the era of wooden steam ships was short-lived due to the introduction of more powerful naval guns and explosive shells, which posed a significant threat to wooden hulls, as demonstrated by the use of red-hot shot and incendiary ammunition."}
{"text": "the transition from wooden to iron hulls in ships began in the 1830s, with the first iron-hulled warship being the gunboat nemesis in 1839, followed by the steam frigates guadelupe and montezuma in 1842, although these iron hulls did not yet provide the protective armor needed to stop enemy gunfire."}
{"text": "following the battle of sinop, emperor napoleon iii ordered the development of armored floating batteries to protect against russian paixhans guns, leading to successful experiments and collaboration with the british to build such vessels."}
{"text": "the french floating batteries, deployed in 1855 during the crimean war, effectively assisted in bombarding shore fortifications at the battle of kinburn and were later used in the italian war, while the british batteries arrived too late for kinburn and were intended for use against kronstadt."}
{"text": "the floating ironclad batteries, despite their limited speed and marginal naval impact, influenced france to develop armored warships for their battlefleet."}
{"text": "by the end of the 1850s, france sought to regain strategic initiative over britain in steam warship construction by launching the first ocean-going ironclad, the gloire, in 1859."}
{"text": "the gloire was a french ironclad warship with a wooden hull sheathed in iron plates, powered by a steam engine, and armed with rifled guns, leading to the construction of additional ironclad warships by france."}
{"text": "the royal navy developed the warrior-class ironclads, hms warrior and hms black prince, to surpass french ships in speed and power, but these ships faced compromises in armor protection and required more maintenance due to their iron construction."}
{"text": "by 1862, european navies, including those of britain, france, austria, italy, russia, and spain, had adopted ironclad ships, with significant developments influenced by their use in the american civil war and the battle of lissa."}
{"text": "the first use of ironclads in action occurred during the u.s. civil war, with the confederacy seeking to gain a naval advantage by acquiring and constructing armored ships."}
{"text": "the css manassas became the first ironclad to enter combat in 1861, followed by the css virginia in 1862, as both the confederate and union navies developed ironclad warships during the american civil war."}
{"text": "the first battle between ironclads on 9 march 1862 during the battle of hampton roads demonstrated the obsolescence of wooden warships as the armored monitor and virginia engaged in combat, marking a significant shift in naval warfare."}
{"text": "during the civil war, both the union and the confederacy built ironclads, with the union constructing a large fleet of monitors and the confederacy facing challenges in acquiring ships from overseas, resulting in only the css stonewall being completed by the war's end."}
{"text": "during the remainder of the war, ironclads played significant roles in union attacks on confederate ports, including the failed attack on charleston and the later attack at mobile bay, involving both union and confederate ironclads."}
{"text": "the union developed a powerful fleet of river ironclads and monitors, designed by engineer james eads, featuring armored casements and shallow drafts for effective river operations during the civil war."}
{"text": "the text discusses the diverse and innovative designs of ironclad vessels during the american civil war, highlighting the trade-offs in technology and design, with no single design being perfect for all combat scenarios."}
{"text": "union ironclads were crucial in the mississippi and its tributaries, providing significant firepower against confederate targets while being more vulnerable to torpedoes (mines) and shore installations than enemy vessels."}
{"text": "the battle of lissa in 1866 was the first fleet and ocean battle involving ironclad warships, fought between the austrian and italian navies with a mix of wooden and ironclad ships."}
{"text": "the italian fleet, comprising 12 ironclads and several wooden warships, aimed to land troops on the adriatic island of lissa, while facing opposition from the austrian navy's seven ironclad frigates."}
{"text": "the austrians, believing their guns to be less effective, engaged the italians at close range in an arrowhead formation to ram them, with the austrian flagship's successful ramming attack gaining notable attention despite both sides' frustration with the lack of damage from guns and the challenges of ramming."}
{"text": "the battle resulted in the loss of two italian ironclads and the survival of the austrian sms kaiser, leading to the popularity of the ram as a weapon and establishing austria as the dominant naval power in the adriatic."}
{"text": "the battles of the american civil war and at lissa significantly influenced ironclad fleet designs and tactics, misleading naval officers to believe ramming was the most effective method to sink enemy ironclads."}
{"text": "the introduction of iron armor on ships rendered light cannon ineffective, leading to the use of heavier guns and a shift towards turret-mounted weaponry for all-round fire, with ramming considered a primary method to sink ironclads."}
{"text": "from the 1860s to the 1880s, naval designers considered the ram to be the most important weapon in naval warfare due to the development of ironclads, steam power, and armor."}
{"text": "the limited effectiveness of gunfire in the battle of hampton roads and the success of ramming at the battle of lissa led to a temporary belief among british naval officers in the late 19th century that ramming would replace guns as the primary naval weapon, despite the low number of ships actually sunk by this method."}
{"text": "the revival of ramming in naval warfare disrupted traditional line-of-battle tactics, as it was unclear how ironclad fleets could effectively use rams in combat."}
{"text": "during the ironclad era, navies focused on developing a small number of powerful guns with increased calibre and weight for better armor penetration, while also dealing with the complexities of rifled versus smoothbore and breech-loading versus muzzle-loading guns."}
{"text": "hms warrior was equipped with a mix of 110-pounder breech-loading rifles and 68-pounder smoothbore guns, highlighting the challenges in selecting appropriate armament, as the breech-loaders designed by sir william armstrong were soon withdrawn from service."}
{"text": "breech-loading guns offered advantages such as easier reloading and greater accuracy, but were ultimately rejected due to persistent design problems."}
{"text": "the breech-loader guns faced issues with sealing the breech, leading to potential gas discharge or breech failure, which reduced muzzle velocity and posed dangers to the gun crew, as seen with the warrior's armstrong guns and similar weapons in the french and german navies."}
{"text": "the british navy progressively equipped ships with increasingly powerful muzzle-loading weapons from the 1880s, culminating in guns weighing up to 81 tons with calibres up to 16 inches."}
{"text": "historians have criticized the decision to retain muzzle-loaders until the 1880s, but until the late 1870s, british muzzle-loaders outperformed french and prussian breech-loaders in range and rate of fire."}
{"text": "from 1875, the shift from muzzle-loading to breech-loading naval guns occurred due to captain de bange's invention for sealing breeches and the impracticality of manually reloading increasingly large guns, leading to the use of complex hydraulic systems."}
{"text": "the royal navy switched to breech-loaders in 1879 due to performance advantages and safety concerns highlighted by an explosion on hms thunderer caused by a muzzle-loading gun being double-loaded."}
{"text": "in the late 19th century, the size and power of naval guns peaked, with ships like hms benbow carrying massive guns, but practical combat effectiveness was limited by accuracy issues and the chaotic conditions of battle."}
{"text": "the text discusses the evolution of propellants in early ironclads, highlighting the transition from black powder to brown powder to increase firepower and reduce stress on cannons."}
{"text": "the development of smokeless powder by paul vielle in 1884 enabled the use of smaller propellant charges with longer barrels, leading to pre-dreadnought battleships in the 1890s having smaller caliber guns but longer barrels for greater muzzle velocity."}
{"text": "during the ironclad period, advancements in projectiles evolved from solid cast-iron shots to chilled iron and eventually to armor-piercing shells."}
{"text": "the first british, french, and russian ironclads, such as gloire and hms warrior, were called \"broadside ironclads\" because they carried their heavy armor and weapons in a single line along their sides, unlike the multi-deck arrangement of earlier wooden ships."}
{"text": "in the 1860s, several countries, primarily britain and france, constructed broadside ironclads, which allowed ships to engage multiple adversaries simultaneously without obstruction from rigging."}
{"text": "the development of ironclad technology and the need for all-round fire led to the replacement of broadside armament designs with central-battery, turret, and barbette designs."}
{"text": "the text describes two main design alternatives to the broadside: the 'box-battery' or 'centre-battery' with guns in an armored casemate amidships, and the turret or barbette with guns on a rotating platform for a broad field of fire."}
{"text": "the centre-battery ship design, exemplified by hms bellerophon in 1865, became popular in the 1860s and 1870s for its compact and maneuverable structure, allowing some guns to fire directly ahead."}
{"text": "the introduction of naval turrets in the 1860s, designed by john ericsson and cowper coles, faced challenges such as limited fire arcs due to masts and rigging, and the heavy weight of turrets, exemplified by the low-freeboard uss monitor and the capsizing of hms captain, which highlighted the difficulties in balancing turret design with traditional ship features."}
{"text": "the barbette, a lighter alternative to the turret used by the french navy, was a fixed armored tower that held a gun on a turntable and became widely adopted in the 1880s, eventually evolving into the turrets of pre-dreadnought battleships."}
{"text": "the ironclad age introduced explosive torpedoes, including static mines and spar torpedoes, which posed significant threats to large warships and influenced naval tactics and designs."}
{"text": "the whitehead torpedo, invented in 1868, became a significant weapon for ironclads in the 1880s, highlighting their vulnerability and influencing naval critiques, although its impact was limited by the brief influence of the jeune ecole school of thought."}
{"text": "iron construction provided engineering benefits for warship hulls, but unarmored iron had military drawbacks and technical issues that prolonged the use of wooden hulls, especially for long-range cruising warships."}
{"text": "iron ships were initially proposed for military use in the 1820s, but by the end of the 1840s, iron-hulled frigates were abandoned due to their vulnerability to solid shot and the brittleness of iron compared to wood."}
{"text": "iron was adopted for battleship construction when protected by armor due to its advantages over wood, such as allowing larger ships, flexible design, and cost-effectiveness, despite initial limitations in supply and existing wooden hulls."}
{"text": "wooden hulls remained popular for long-range and smaller ironclads due to the quick fouling of iron hulls by marine life, which required a laborious and expensive sheathing process with wood and copper."}
{"text": "after 1872, steel began to be used in construction for its superior strength-to-weight ratio compared to iron, with the french navy pioneering its use in ships like the redoutable, which still incorporated some iron elements."}
{"text": "despite leading in steel production, britain was slow to adopt steel warships due to imperfections in the bessemer process, with the royal navy's first all-steel ships being iris and mercury, built in the mid-1870s."}
{"text": "iron-built ships like hms warrior used wood, specifically teak, in their protection scheme to prevent spalling and structural damage, and this combination was later used in 'sandwich' armor on ships like hms inflexible."}
{"text": "steel became practical for use in armor when it was fused onto wrought iron plates to create compound armor, which was adopted by the british, french, and german navies in the late 19th century."}
{"text": "the italian ironclads caio duilio and enrico dandolo were the first to have all-steel armor, with france and britain transitioning to steel armor in the 1880s."}
{"text": "the development of case-hardened nickel-steel armor, particularly through the harvey and krupp processes, marked significant advancements in naval armor technology from the 1890s, with krupp armor becoming the standard for battleships by 1901."}
{"text": "the text compares the equivalent strengths of different types of armor plates, stating that 15 inches of wrought iron is equivalent to 12 inches of plain steel or compound iron and steel armor, 7.75 inches of harvey armor, or 5.75 inches of krupp armor."}
{"text": "the text discusses the evolution of battleship armor design, highlighting the limitations of early ironclad ships like warrior and inflexible, which had partial armor protection and relied on cork-filled compartments and watertight bulkheads for stability."}
{"text": "the first ocean-going ironclads initially retained masts and sails due to inefficient early steam engines, and featured design elements like retractable screws and telescopic funnels to aid hybrid propulsion."}
{"text": "the british hms devastation, launched in 1869, was the first large ocean-going ironclad to be built without masts, designed primarily for combat in european waters, while most ironclads of the 1870s still retained masts except for those of the italian navy."}
{"text": "during the 1860s, the adoption of double-expansion steam engines, which used significantly less coal, became widespread in the royal navy, but issues with boiler technology and strategic considerations prevented the complete transition from sails to steam."}
{"text": "during the 1870s, a distinction emerged between battleships and cruising ironclads, with the former requiring heavy armor and armament that reduced sailing speed, leading to the eventual abandonment of sailing rigs on ironclad battleships by the 1880s."}
{"text": "sails remained in use on cruising ironclads for an extended period, with various navies developing long-range ironclads throughout the 1860s and 1870s, until the royal navy introduced hms warspite in 1888, marking a shift towards steam-powered armored warships."}
{"text": "the final evolution of ironclad propulsion involved the adoption of the triple-expansion steam engine, first used in hms sans pareil in 1891, with forced draught systems providing additional power until the steam turbine's introduction in the mid-1900s."}
{"text": "ironclads were rapidly adopted by navies worldwide, but few major naval battles involved them, as they were primarily used by the british royal navy for defense and power projection, with engagements often highlighting the risks of naval intervention."}
{"text": "the united kingdom's royal navy, which was the largest in the world during the ironclad period, developed coast-defense battleships like the devastation class to adapt to new naval warfare strategies, but faced challenges such as vulnerability to mines and obstructions, leading to the naval defence act and the 'two-power standard' to maintain naval superiority."}
{"text": "during the ironclad period, british ships primarily engaged in colonial battles, such as the 1882 bombardment of alexandria, where they faced little effective resistance from egyptian forces despite heavy initial return fire."}
{"text": "the french navy initially led in ironclad innovation to compete with the british but could not match the royal navy's size, and later shifted focus to torpedo boats and unarmored cruisers, with their ironclads seeing little action."}
{"text": "russia developed ironclads and innovative naval designs, such as the general-admiral armored cruiser and poorly designed 'popovkas,' and expanded its navy with modern ships in the late 19th century, but suffered defeat at the battle of tsushima due to inexperienced crews and politically appointed leadership."}
{"text": "the u.s. navy transitioned from having a limited ironclad fleet post-civil war to building modern pre-dreadnoughts and armored cruisers in the 1890s, which played a crucial role in defeating the spanish fleet in the spanish-american war of 1898, marking a new era of naval warfare."}

{"text": "the text explains that the constant k represents the characteristic impedance, z0, of a transmission line formed by infinitesimally small sections and serves as the image impedance at resonance for band-pass filters or at \u03c9 = 0 for low-pass filters."}
{"text": "the filter's image impedance is purely real in the pass band and purely imaginary in the stop band, as it lacks resistive elements."}
{"text": "the prototype with a 1 farad value can be impedance and frequency scaled, and transformed into low-pass, high-pass, band-pass, or band-stop types using appropriate frequency transformations."}
{"text": "several l-shaped half-sections can be combined to create a composite filter, forming either a \u03c0 section or a t section depending on the orientation of the image impedances, and further additions result in a ladder network."}
{"text": "the accuracy of filter characteristics predicted by the image method depends on termination with its image impedance, and deviations occur at the ends where fixed resistance is used, with accuracy improving further from the ends."}
